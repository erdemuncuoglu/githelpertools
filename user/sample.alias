# Sample Alias File
#
# Each alias file must have extension '.alias'.
# Empty lines and lines statring with a # sign are considered as a comment line (like this one) and ignored.
# Alias definitions are same as GIT alias definition except no whitespaces around '=' character.
#
# e.g. Take a look at 'conf/core.alias' for a real example
